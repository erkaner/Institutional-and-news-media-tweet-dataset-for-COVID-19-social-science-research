---------------------
UPDATE EVERY THURSDAY
---------------------

Feel free to share this repo.

Data collected using twitter REST API.

First data collection at March 12, 2020 (updated on my PC every week).
This means the first time I collect the most recent 3200 tweets (official limits) of all the target accounts, then update weekly.


First online: April 2, 2020

V1.1: update data from April 2 to April 8.

----------
IMPORTANT:
----------
Data crawled by twitter account user name (same as txt file name), some of the accounts may lost maintaince for long time (for example @SanidadPublicaEs, stop tweeting at 2014, but activate this account again when COVID-19 became global crisis).

I did NOT remove the historical data before coronavirus outbreak. Any questions please contact with me (see email below).
