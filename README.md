# Institional-and-news-media-tweet-dataset-for-COVID-19-social-science-research
Open access data repository for institutional/news media tweet dataset in the time of COVID-19 pandemic

---------------------
UPDATE EVERY THURSDAY
---------------------

News media and government/international organization tweets across different countries (eg. US, UK, China, Spain, France, Germany etc)
Feel free to share this repo.

Data collected using twitter REST API.

First data collection at March 12, 2020 (updated on my PC every week).
This means the first time I collect the most recent 3200 tweets (official limits) of all the target accounts, then update weekly.


First online update: April 2, 2020

----------
IMPORTANT:
----------
Data crawled by twitter account user name (same as txt file name), some of the accounts may lost maintaince for long time (for example @SanidadPublicaEs, stop tweeting at 2014, but activate this account another time when COVID-19 became global crisis).

I did NOT clean the historical data before coronavirus outbreak. Any questions, contact with me (see email below)
